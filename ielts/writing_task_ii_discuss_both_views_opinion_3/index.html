<blockquote>
<p><strong>One of the most controversial issues today relates to</strong> the most important part of salary of jobs. <strong>There are, however, some people who hold the belief which revolves around</strong> other essential factors. <strong>The opposing opinions relating to such concern should be thoroughly discussed and some personal ideas should also be introduced.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>One of the strongest arguments in favor of</strong> money, which is the most crucial part in jobs, <strong>can be attributed to</strong> the prospects of prosperity. The individuals, who earn an envious income, can effortlessly spend money on their extravagant hobbies irrespective of how expensive they are. Besides, they are able to help their loved ones with their fortune and recieve the admiration from other people. <strong>This can result in the fact that</strong> achieving a hefty salary evidently gives people material comfort.</p>
<p><strong>There are, however, some arguments that oppose</strong> the importance of high earnings, which is the most important part in occupations. <strong>The most typical of these is</strong> other more important factors, namely safety at work, or enthusiasm. Many jobs offer a high salary in order to serve dangerous cases, are able to inflict a sense of insecurity and unease on workers. On the other hand, some employees, who are involved in positions which do not bring to them the confort and interest in work, wil be unproductive compared to their devoting counterparts. <strong>Therefore</strong>, these factors will impact how long employees stay loyal to the companies and how strong their dedication to working.</p>
<p><strong>Personally, I am strongly of the opinion that</strong> the highly-praised importance of money <strong>is <em>disadvantageous</em> in some certain aspects</strong>. <strong>The most conclusive evidence emphasizes</strong> the prospects of career leaps. A high salary earning is normally the most desirable factor when it comes to jobs, but people are extremely concerned about how their career develops. Any job should have defined a clear, detail employment development for employees, mostly, who are aware of prospect of career. Because they are not dazzled by incentives, instead higher-level positions, or even a envious income in the future are prioritized. As a result, the whole community will gradually be improved by people who keep self-motivation in development of employment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>In conclusion, I tend to believe that</strong> the most important part of salary in jobs is a bad trend. <strong>The government should</strong> impose safety-related regulations on firms to serve the purpose of helping workplaces with good conditions for workers. <strong>Besides, people</strong> should have a sense of true value of labour, which lies in how enjoyable in working they are, instead of the attraction of irresistible coins.</p>
