<p><strong>The graph and table below show the average monthly temperatures and the average number of hours of sunshine per year in three major cities.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.</strong></p>
<p><em>Write at least 150 words.</em></p>

<p>As you can see, the given chart is a time-based figure and we can effortlessly tackle it, but the question also enquires us to summarize the information in the table. This type of figure is called non-time-based time and we can use some structures below to describe it.</p>
<ol>
<li>To be more specific, name of the highest bars + verb + data, which stood at the peak.</li>
<li>Next, name of the second highest bars + ranked the second + <strong>with</strong> + data.</li>
<li>Moreover, the proportion/rate/number/amount + <strong>of</strong> + name of the third highest bars + verb + data.</li>
<li>Also, there was/were + data + in + name of the fourth highest bars.</li>
<li>Besides, name of the fifth highest bar + <strong>saw/witnessed the quantity of</strong> + data.</li>
<li>Furthermore, name of the sixth highest bar + <strong>was/were recorded</strong> at + data.</li>

<li>
<p>Write the introduction and overview section</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The chart and table illustrate the mean of monthly temperatures and the average number of sunshine hours in three major cities in one year period.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>From an overall perspective, the average monthly temperatures and the average number of hours of sunshine per year in London, New York, Sydney all varied with different proportions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Notice</strong>: we do not include the groups of a similar trend in the overview section, instead, we will give these in the description.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write the description for the chart
We easily see that New York and Sydney have the same trend in the chart. The temperature increased from January to July and decreased from July to December. Thus, we describe New York and Sydney in a group. Similarly, we will describe London in one group.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To be more specific, the avarage monthly temperatures in London significantly decreased from 25 degree in January to 15 degree in July. Afterwards, there was a dramatic drop in the mean monthly temperatures in London from 15 degree to 25 degree between July and December.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>By contrast, the statistics revealed a remarkable growp in monthly average temperatures in New York from 8 degree in January to 23 degree in July. And then, it witnessed a dramatic decrease from 23 degree to 10 degree. Likewise, there was a significant incease in monthly average temperatures in Sydney from 4 degree, which occupied the lowest value, to 28 degree, which accounted for the highest value, between January and July. Afterwards, the monthly average temperatures in Sydney dramatically declined from 28 degree to 5 degree.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write the description for the table</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turning to the yearly average hours of sunshine, New York attained 2,535 hours, which stood at the peak. Next, the average hours of sunshine per year in Sydney ranked the second with 2,473 hours. Finally, the average hours of sunside per year in London saw the quantity of 1,180 hours.</p>
