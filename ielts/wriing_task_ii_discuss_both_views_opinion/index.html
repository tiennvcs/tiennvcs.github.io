<p><strong>Writing task II</strong></p>
<p><em>Some people think that it&rsquo;s important to spend money on family celebrations (e.g., weddings, birthdays). But something expensive celebrations are a waste of money. Discuss both views and give your opinion.</em></p>
<p>There are two opposing beliefs given in the question:</p>
<ol>
<li>it&rsquo;s important to spend money on family celebrations</li>
<li>expensive celebrations are a waste of money.</li>
</ol>
<p>And it enquires us discuss two issues and give some ideas about them. So we will have three paragraphs, one for approval of 1st statement, one for support of 2nd belief, and the other for our own opinion. Here is my outline before writing the answer to encounter this question type.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Introduction</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the most controversial issues today relates to <strong>&hellip;1st issue&hellip;</strong>. There are, however, some people which hold the belief that <strong>&hellip;2nd issue&hellip;</strong>. The two opposing views should be thoroughly considered and some personal ideas should also be introduced.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>$\rightarrow$ paraphrase the 1st statement into 1st issue and fill the bold text. The same for 2nd issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Body</p>
<p>The first paragraph in the body section will discuss 1st issue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the strongest arguments in favor of <strong>&hellip;1st issue&hellip;</strong> can be attributed to <strong>&hellip;1st idea&hellip;</strong>. The main reason for believing this is <strong>&hellip;1st why&hellip;</strong>. <strong>1st result</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second paragraph discusses 2nd issue. Notice that we utilize 2nd issue for 2nd idea to protest against 1st issue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are, however, some arguments that oppose <strong>&hellip;1st issue&hellip;</strong>. The most typical of these is <strong>&hellip;2nd idea $\approx$ 2nd issue&hellip;</strong>. <strong>&hellip;2nd why&hellip;</strong>. Therefore, <strong>2nd result</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the last paragraph, we will give an opinion about the 1st issue, whether it is good or not, explain why, and the result.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Personally, I am strongly of opinion that <strong>1st issue</strong> is <strong>advantageous/disadvantageous</strong> to some extend. The most conclusive evidence emphasizes <strong>&hellip;3rd idea&hellip;</strong>. <strong>&hellip;3rd why&hellip;</strong>. As a result, <strong>&hellip;3nd result&hellip;</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, I tend to believe that <strong>&hellip;your opinion about 1st issue and mention 2nd issue&hellip;</strong>. The government/people should <strong>&hellip;advice&hellip;</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>One of the most controversial issues today relates to</strong> the emphasis on splendid celebrations of weddings or birthdays. <strong>There are, however, some people which hold the belief that</strong> it is a waste of money. <strong>The two opposing views should be thoroughly considered and some personal ideas should also be introduced.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>One of the strongest arguments in favor of</strong> the extravagant celebration of weddings or birthdays can be attributed to its widely-held values, financially and sentimentally. <strong>The main reason for believing this is</strong> the parties which indulge in top-notch food and luxirious atmosphere can help validate the social status of the owners. They, reputedly, can gain higher respect or awe from the others who are dazzled by the sophistication and sumptuousness of the revelries. Furthermore, the parties which ain to impress a particular individual should also be lavishly invested. This helps the organizers occupy the favored position in the heart of their objects.</p>
<p><strong>There are, however, some arguments that oppose</strong> the costly parties. The most typical of these is the accusation of wastefulness. The budget spent on the celebration can otherwise be allocated for other practical activities, namely paying for healthcare or insurance in case of something untowards emerge. Therefore, it can prove more meaningful as the spent money can help people with more sense of security and ease rather than mislead them fleeting moments of excitement and indulgence.</p>
<p><strong>Personally, I am of the opinion that</strong> throwing exorbitant parties is <strong>disadvantages to some extent.</strong> <strong>The most conclusive evidence emphasizes</strong> the annoyance and bitterness fermented inside the neighbors. The noisy music or beer-reeked conversations can deprive people around of their deserving sleep, not to mention some resultant verbal or even physical abuse as the endurance is stretched to its limit. <strong>Therefore</strong>, humble celebration should be taken into consideration.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>In conclusion, I tend to believe that</strong> spending a hefty amount of money on luxirious celebrations is a bad trend and it is extremely sumptuous.<strong>People should</strong> use their fortune for meaningful objectives, namely investment, academic pursuit or social donation activities.</p>
