<h2 id="what-is-ielts">What is IELTS?</h2>
<hr>
<p>IELTS is the abbreviation for International English Language Testing System, which is created to help you study, and migrate to a country where English is the native language such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the USA. Your English ability is evaluated through 4 skills: listening, reading, writing and speaking.</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.ielts.org/about-ielts/what-is-ielts">https://www.ielts.org/about-ielts/what-is-ielts</a></p>
<h2 id="ielts-range-score">IELTS range score</h2>
<hr>
<p>IELTS is graded on a scale of 1-9. It means with every single skill, you will be received a score in the range of 1-9 and the average score of 4 skills is the final score (IELTS score) you would be assessed.</p>
<p>A band score you took from the IELTS exam shows your English capacity. If you got 9 in general, Wonderful, you are a genius! But if you are a newbie in learning English, you easily got lesser than equal to 5. For me, my aim is <strong>6.5</strong> in general. This band score is in the middle of <strong>6</strong>, the test taker has an effective command of the language despite some inaccuracies, inappropriate usage and misunderstandings and <strong>7</strong>, you have operational command of the language, though with occasional inaccuracies, inappropriate usage and misunderstandings in some situations, generally handle complex language well and understand detailed reasoning.</p>
<h2 id="ielts-listening-test">IELTS Listening test</h2>
<hr>
<p>You will hear 4 different recordings with 40 questions in total and the recording will have 10 questions. You must write the answer that you think is correct to your answer sheet. There are many kinds of questions in listening like completing (filling) a form, matching information, multiple choices, completing a summary, labeling a map/diagram, etc.</p>
<h2 id="ielts-reading-test">IELTS Reading test</h2>
<hr>
<p>In the reading section, you are given 3 separate passages and corresponding questions and your task is to write the answer that you suppose is correct to your answer sheet. There are totally 40 questions with a wide variety of types such as TRUE/FALSE/NOT GIVEN, matching headings, filling diagram, etc.</p>
<h2 id="ielts-writing-test">IELTS Writing test</h2>
<hr>
<p>There are two tasks in writing including Writing Task I and Writing Task II. In task I, you will be given a chart/table/process and your responsibility is to <strong>summarize</strong> the information by selecting and representing the essential points and making comparisons where relevant. But in task II, you will write <strong>an essay</strong> that discusses a specific topic such as <em>&ldquo;Some people think that mental strength is the most important for success in sport. However, some others believe that it is more important to have strong and fit people. Discuss both views and give your opinions.&quot;</em> The length of your essay should be not lesser than equal to 250 words and in task I, the lower bound is 150 words.</p>
<h2 id="ielts-speaking-test">IELTS Speaking test</h2>
<hr>
<p>You will speak with an examiner in 11 to 14 minutes. The test contains 3 parts and you should speak naturally and natively as much as possible. The first part (Part I) is the start-up so the examiner  just asks you some questions about yourself such as <em>Tell me about your hometown?</em>, <em>Do you work or study?</em>, <em>What is the most interesting thing in your hometown?</em>. And then, you will move to part II where you will be given a cue card including a topic and some suggestions and you must talk about it in no longer than 2 minutes. For example, <em>Describe a game or sport you enjoy playing</em>. And in the final part (Part 3), you and the examiner will discuss more deeply the topic given in Part II. Of course, you answer the questions of the examiner.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>In the next post, I will start the journey with some examples in IELTS Writing Task II. The reason why I select Writing as a starting point is I think I should start with my strengths</em></p>
